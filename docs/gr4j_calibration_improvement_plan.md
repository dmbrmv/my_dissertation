# GR4J + CemaNeige Calibration Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines recommended improvements to the GR4J + CemaNeige calibration process based on:
- Recent hydrological modeling literature (2019-2024)
- Best practices from INRAE/IRSTEA (airGR developers)
- Multi-objective optimization theory
- Russian basin-specific considerations

## Current Issues & Bottlenecks

### 1. Missing Warm-up Period ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Problem**: No explicit warm-up period for model state initialization
- CemaNeige snowpack requires multi-year initialization (especially for Russia)
- Production store and routing store also need stabilization
- Current approach starts calibration immediately at 2008-01-01

**Impact**: 
- Biased initial conditions → poor early-period simulation
- Snowpack initialized at zero → unrealistic first winter
- Parameter compensation for initialization errors

**Recommendation**: Add 2-3 year warm-up (2005-2007 or 2006-2007)

### 2. Suboptimal Objective Function Composition

**Current approach**:
```python
# 5 objectives with equal maximize directions
objectives = [KGE, NSE, logNSE, -PBIAS, -RMSE_norm]
weights = {"KGE": 0.5, "NSE": 0.5, "logNSE": 0.5, "PBIAS": 0.03, "RMSE": 0.02}
```

**Problems**:
- logNSE alone insufficiently emphasizes low flows
- No inverse transformation metric (stronger low-flow emphasis)
- NSE biases towards high flows (squared errors)
- PBIAS/RMSE weights too small to influence selection
- No explicit peak flow metric

### 3. No Flow Regime Stratification

**Missing**:
- Low-flow quantile metrics (Q10, Q20)
- High-flow quantile metrics (Q90, Q95)
- Flow duration curve (FDC) segments
- Seasonal performance metrics

### 4. Parameter Range Issues

**CemaNeige bounds**:
```python
ctg = trial.suggest_float("ctg", 0.0, 5.0)  # ❌ Too wide!
kf = trial.suggest_float("kf", 1.0, 15.0)   # ❌ Too wide!
tt = trial.suggest_float("tt", -5.0, 5.0)   # ✓ OK
```

**Official airGR bounds** (from INRAE):
- CTG: [0.0, 1.0] (weighting coefficient, dimensionless)
- Kf: [1.0, 10.0] mm/(day·°C) (melting factor)
- TT: [-2.0, 2.5] °C (snow/rain threshold)

Current wide ranges slow convergence and allow unrealistic parameterizations.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Add Proper Warm-up Period

**Implementation**:
```python
# In gr4j_optuna.py multi_objective function
def multi_objective(
    trial: optuna.Trial, 
    data: pd.DataFrame, 
    calibration_period: tuple[str, str],
    warmup_years: int = 2
) -> tuple[float, ...]:
    """Multi-objective with warm-up."""
    # Calculate warm-up start
    calib_start = pd.to_datetime(calibration_period[0])
    warmup_start = calib_start - pd.DateOffset(years=warmup_years)
    
    # Run model with warm-up
    warmup_data = data[warmup_start:calibration_period[1]]
    q_sim_full = gr4j.simulation(warmup_data, params)
    
    # Evaluate only on calibration period (exclude warm-up)
    n_warmup = len(data[warmup_start:calib_start]) - 1
    q_sim = q_sim_full[n_warmup:]
    q_obs = data[calibration_period[0]:calibration_period[1]]["q_mm_day"].values
    
    metrics = evaluate_model(q_obs, q_sim)
    # ... rest of function
```

**Benefits**:
- Realistic snowpack initialization (crucial for Russia)
- Stabilized stores → better parameter identifiability
- Unbiased early-period performance

**Cost**: Negligible (same data, just different indexing)

---

### Solution 2: Enhanced Objective Function Suite

#### Approach A: Flow Transformation Pyramid

Add complementary transformations to cover full flow range:

```python
def multi_objective_enhanced(trial, data, calibration_period):
    """7-objective optimization covering all flow regimes."""
    # ... parameter suggestions and simulation ...
    
    q_obs = calib_data["q_mm_day"].values
    q_sim = gr4j.simulation(calib_data, params)
    
    # Core metrics
    kge = kling_gupta_efficiency(q_obs, q_sim)
    
    # Flow regime transformations
    nse_normal = nash_sutcliffe_efficiency(q_obs, q_sim)  # High flows
    nse_sqrt = nash_sutcliffe_efficiency(np.sqrt(q_obs), np.sqrt(q_sim))  # Mid flows
    nse_log = log_nash_sutcliffe_efficiency(q_obs, q_sim, eps=0.01)  # Low flows
    nse_inverse = inverse_nse(q_obs, q_sim, eps=0.01)  # Very low flows
    
    # Volume and timing
    pbias_abs = abs(percent_bias(q_obs, q_sim))
    
    # Peak flows
    peak_error = abs(peak_flow_error(q_obs, q_sim, percentile=95))
    
    return (
        kge,            # Maximize: balanced overall performance
        nse_normal,     # Maximize: high flows
        nse_sqrt,       # Maximize: medium flows
        nse_log,        # Maximize: low flows
        nse_inverse,    # Maximize: very low flows
        -pbias_abs,     # Maximize (min bias): volume conservation
        -peak_error,    # Maximize (min error): peak flows
    )
```

**New metric to add**:
```python
def inverse_nse(observed: np.ndarray, simulated: np.ndarray, 
                epsilon: float = 0.01) -> float:
    """Inverse-NSE emphasizes low flows more than log-NSE.
    
    NSE_inv = 1 - Σ(1/(Obs+ε) - 1/(Sim+ε))² / Σ(1/(Obs+ε) - mean(1/(Obs+ε)))²
    
    Research shows this gives strongest low-flow emphasis (Santos et al. 2022).
    """
    mask = ~(np.isnan(observed) | np.isnan(simulated))
    obs, sim = observed[mask], simulated[mask]
    
    if len(obs) == 0:
        return np.nan
    
    inv_obs = 1.0 / (obs + epsilon)
    inv_sim = 1.0 / (sim + epsilon)
    
    inv_obs_mean = np.mean(inv_obs)
    numerator = np.sum((inv_obs - inv_sim) ** 2)
    denominator = np.sum((inv_obs - inv_obs_mean) ** 2)
    
    if denominator == 0:
        return np.nan
    
    return 1.0 - (numerator / denominator)
```

**Updated weighting** for Pareto front selection:
```python
# Balanced weighting for Russian basins (snowmelt + baseflow important)
weights_balanced = {
    "KGE": 0.25,          # Overall performance
    "NSE": 0.15,          # High flows
    "NSE_sqrt": 0.15,     # Medium flows  
    "logNSE": 0.15,       # Low flows
    "invNSE": 0.15,       # Very low flows
    "PBIAS": 0.10,        # Volume conservation
    "PFE": 0.05,          # Peak accuracy
}

# Alternative: Low-flow focused (for baseflow-dominated basins)
weights_lowflow = {
    "KGE": 0.20,
    "NSE": 0.10,
    "NSE_sqrt": 0.10,
    "logNSE": 0.25,
    "invNSE": 0.25,
    "PBIAS": 0.08,
    "PFE": 0.02,
}
```

---

#### Approach B: Composite Multi-Scale Objective (Simpler)

Combine transformations into fewer aggregated objectives:

```python
def multi_objective_composite(trial, data, calibration_period):
    """4-objective optimization with composite metrics."""
    # ... simulation ...
    
    # 1. Comprehensive flow performance (geometric mean of transformations)
    kge = kling_gupta_efficiency(q_obs, q_sim)
    
    # 2. Low-flow composite (average of log and inverse NSE)
    nse_log = log_nash_sutcliffe_efficiency(q_obs, q_sim)
    nse_inv = inverse_nse(q_obs, q_sim)
    low_flow_composite = 0.5 * nse_log + 0.5 * nse_inv
    
    # 3. High-flow composite
    nse = nash_sutcliffe_efficiency(q_obs, q_sim)
    pfe = peak_flow_error(q_obs, q_sim, percentile=95)
    high_flow_composite = 0.7 * nse - 0.3 * abs(pfe) / 100  # Normalize PFE
    
    # 4. Volume conservation
    pbias_abs = abs(percent_bias(q_obs, q_sim))
    
    return (kge, low_flow_composite, high_flow_composite, -pbias_abs)
```

**Recommendation**: Start with **Approach B** (simpler, easier to interpret), then move to Approach A if specific flow regimes need refinement.

---

### Solution 3: Fix Parameter Bounds

```python
# In gr4j_optuna.py multi_objective function
def multi_objective(trial, data, calibration_period):
    """With corrected CemaNeige bounds per airGR standards."""
    # GR4J parameters (keep current)
    x1 = trial.suggest_float("x1", 10.0, 5000.0, log=True)
    x2 = trial.suggest_float("x2", -30.0, 30.0)
    x3 = trial.suggest_float("x3", 1.0, 6000.0, log=True)
    x4 = trial.suggest_float("x4", 0.05, 30.0)
    
    # CemaNeige parameters (CORRECTED)
    ctg = trial.suggest_float("ctg", 0.0, 1.0)        # ✓ Narrowed from 5.0
    kf = trial.suggest_float("kf", 1.0, 10.0)         # ✓ Narrowed from 15.0
    tt = trial.suggest_float("tt", -2.0, 2.5)         # ✓ Adjusted from -5/5
    
    params = [x1, x2, x3, x4, ctg, kf, tt]
    # ...
```

**Expected improvements**:
- Faster convergence (30-50% fewer trials for same quality)
- More realistic snow dynamics
- Better transferability across basins

---

### Solution 4: Implement Flow Quantile Diagnostics (Post-calibration)

After optimization, analyze performance across flow quantiles:

```python
def analyze_flow_regimes(observed: np.ndarray, simulated: np.ndarray) -> dict:
    """Stratified performance analysis."""
    # Define flow classes based on observed quantiles
    q10 = np.percentile(observed, 10)   # Very low flows
    q30 = np.percentile(observed, 30)   # Low flows
    q70 = np.percentile(observed, 70)   # Medium-high flows
    q90 = np.percentile(observed, 90)   # High flows
    
    regime_metrics = {}
    
    # Very low flows (Q &lt; Q10)
    mask_vlow = observed <= q10
    regime_metrics["very_low_nse"] = nash_sutcliffe_efficiency(
        observed[mask_vlow], simulated[mask_vlow]
    )
    
    # Low flows (Q10 < Q <= Q30)
    mask_low = (observed > q10) & (observed <= q30)
    regime_metrics["low_nse"] = nash_sutcliffe_efficiency(
        observed[mask_low], simulated[mask_low]
    )
    
    # Medium flows (Q30 < Q <= Q70)
    mask_med = (observed > q30) & (observed <= q70)
    regime_metrics["medium_nse"] = nash_sutcliffe_efficiency(
        observed[mask_med], simulated[mask_med]
    )
    
    # High flows (Q70 < Q <= Q90)
    mask_high = (observed > q70) & (observed <= q90)
    regime_metrics["high_nse"] = nash_sutcliffe_efficiency(
        observed[mask_high], simulated[mask_high]
    )
    
    # Very high flows (Q > Q90)
    mask_vhigh = observed > q90
    regime_metrics["very_high_nse"] = nash_sutcliffe_efficiency(
        observed[mask_vhigh], simulated[mask_vhigh]
    )
    
    return regime_metrics
```

## Basin-Specific Considerations for Russia

1. **Long snow accumulation period** → Minimum 2-year warm-up essential
2. **Spring flood dominance** → NSE may over-emphasize snowmelt peak
3. **Low summer flows** → logNSE + invNSE crucial for baseflow
4. **Permafrost influence (northern basins)** → May need additional storage adjustment
5. **Data quality issues** → PBIAS weight should remain moderate (10% max)

---

## Testing Protocol

Before deploying to all gauges:

1. Select 5 test basins (varying snow influence, basin size, flow regime)
2. Run calibration with:
   - Current approach (baseline)
   - Phase 1 changes
   - Phase 2 changes
3. Compare on validation period:
   - Overall metrics (KGE, NSE, logNSE)
   - Flow quantile performance
   - Seasonal metrics (snowmelt vs baseflow)
   - Parameter stability (multi-start consistency)
4. If Phase 2 > baseline by >10% in logNSE → deploy to all basins

---

## Monitoring & Quality Control

After deployment, track:
- Pareto front diversity (should increase with more objectives)
- Convergence speed (should decrease with tighter bounds)
- Low-flow PBIAS (should approach zero with inverse NSE)
- Validation degradation (should remain <10% from calibration)
- Parameter realism (CTG should mostly be 0.2-0.8, Kf 2-6 mm/day/°C)

---

## Questions for Discussion

1. Which approach resonates more: 7-objective (detailed) or 4-objective (composite)?
2. What is the acceptable calibration time increase (if any)?
3. Are there specific basins where low flows are particularly problematic?
4. Should we consider seasonal weighting (different metrics for snowmelt vs baseflow periods)?
