# To use different dynamic inputs per frequency, this variable must contain a dict mapping each frequency to its
# list of variables. E.g., to use precipitation from daymet for daily and from nldas_hourly for hourly predictions:

# with one key for each basin and the value is a time indexed data frame, where each column is a 
# feature.

# same row (datetime) as the target discharge value.
